# Most_used_MITRE_ATTACK_techniques_evaluation

This project utilizes the evaluation of the most used ATT&CK techniques from APTs.
The dataset was given by MITRE -> https://attack.mitre.org/resources/working-with-attack/

We utilized the evaluation based on 5 Tactics from ATT&CK Matrix (Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Command and Control) for research purposes.
This code can easy be expanded to support all the Tactics of the Matrix.

You can find the results of the evaluation in the excel worksheet : "MOST USED TECHNIQUES.xlsx"
